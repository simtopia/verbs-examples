VERBS simulations
==================

*Very Efficient Rust Blockchain Simulator*

Verbs is a Python ABM (agent based modelling) library built
around a core Rust ABM library.

It is designed to allow you to quickly implement agent-based
simulations of the Ethereum blockchain.

In https://github.com/simtopia/verbs-examples we present two simulations
with Aave, Uniswap, and several agents interacting with them
(Uniswap traders, borrowers and liquidators).
